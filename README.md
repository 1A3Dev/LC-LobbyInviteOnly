### Information

This mod adds a new button when hosting a lobby which allows you to set it as invite-only. It was designed for people who want to play alone or with a specific group of friends without uninvited people being able to join.

This is also useful if you or someone in your lobby has their steam "game details" privacy setting as public as that allows anyone to join a friends-only lobby by clicking the join button on the person's public steam profile.

_Note: Only the lobby host needs this mod, it does nothing for clients and is not required to be able to accept an invitation to an invite-only lobby._
